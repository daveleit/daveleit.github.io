Laura Lee Coles says <i>Trees</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;"is a contemplative work, that shares a sense of Nature in the Park as experienced during different seasons. As people may find themselves more indoors than desired, Trees provides soothing moments of technological nature and the memory of place. Research shows that there is some benefit experiencing technological nature than no nature at all."

Original videos with sound can be seen at <a target="_lank" href="https://imapon.org/Co-Vid-EO/">https://imapon.org/Co-Vid-EO/</a>. This on-line project is in partnership with Vancouver Park Board: Arts, Culture and Engagement.

Most sounds came from a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.moogmusic.com/products/moog-one">Moog ONE synthesizer</a>.
