<h1>
Inspiration
</h1>
<p>This project is a personal project. As much as I’d like to release these pcb layouts designs for SDIY there are several issues; Firstly there are many errors as this is a first time (and only time) build, layouts were done in a drawing program, not a circuit board layout program. Nothing has been updated or corrected except by cutting/moving traces and connections based on re-reading the schematics. No documentation by me for this exists. Secondly I don’t have Don Buchla’s permission to release these versions (flawed or not). Lastly, it’s built, sounds great and I want to spend time playing music not updating hand written notes and documentation and layouts.</p>
<p>The design is based on the Buchla Music Easel which is pictured in the <a target="_blank" href="https://buchla.com/history/">history section</a> of the Buchla website. The original blueprints can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://rubidium.se/~magnus/synths/companies/buchla/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve used a different oscillator design, the Buchla 259. Features have been added (octave switching) and others removed (autotune &amp; remote). The building of this design is another story. This link also has bare sound samples of the 259 oscillator showing timbre, amplitude and pitch modulation as well as phase lock</p>
The Easel balanced modulator shows up as the top switch in the oscillator modulation switch. The switch selects:
<ol>
<li>
pre-amp only,
</li>
<li>
balanced modulator with complex and modulation as sources,
</li>
<li>
pre-amp with balanced modulator/mod osc.
</li>
</ol>
<p>My panel also uses only rotary pots instead of a combination of sliders and pots. This panel has a few additional patch points that on the original were only accessible through the preset cards. I needed to do this as I had decided not to include the card based preset system.</p>
<p>The original Easel would come with a touch sensitive keyboard. I’m going to use my Serge TKB to do this for now.</p>
<p>Sample sound created when doing final testing are at the bottom of this page.</p>

Making the Four Additional Circuit Boards (the 259 has 2 more)
</h1>
<p>The blueprints are hand drawn into Adobe Illustrator, then printed with black and white laser toner, then etched and drilled.</p>

<p><img class="pic" src="../../images/synth/P1010089.jpg"> The first 2 boards are stuffed with parts.</p>
<p><img class="pic" src="../../images/synth/P1010114.jpg"> All the boards now ready for a total of 6 boards.</p>
<p><img class="pic" src="../../images/synth/P1010118sm.jpg"> Working on the enclosure. The final ended up slightly different.</p>
<p><img class="pic" src="../../images/synth/EnclosureTopView.gif"> Wiring up the 259 and testing - it does sound pretty awesome, extra side board covers a few missed LED drivers and a buchla gate convertor (combined gate/pulse) and a small 5 volt supply.</p>

Adding a Touch controlled keyboard
</h1>
<p>The design is based on the Buchla 216 with a quantizer from Mucic from Outer Space and a a voltage controlled lag processor from the Buchla 208 keyboard.</p>
