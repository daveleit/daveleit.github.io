As much as I'd like to release these pcb layouts designs for SDIY there are several issues;<br />			Firstly there are many errors as this is a first time (and only time) build, layouts were done in a drawing program, not a circuit board layout program. Nothing has been updated or corrected except by cutting/moving traces and connections based on re-reading the schematics. No documentation by me for this exists.<br />Secondly I don't have Don Buchla's permission to release these versions (flawed or not). <br />Lastly, it's built, sounds great and I want to spend time playing music not updating hand written notes and documentation and layouts.<br />			<br />			The design is based on the Buchla Music Easel which is pictured in the <a href="http://www.buchla.com/history/" target="_blank"><i>history section</i></a> of the Buchla website. <br />				The original blueprints can be found<em> <a href="http://rubidium.dyndns.org/%7emagnus/synths/companies/buchla/" target="_blank">here</a></em>.<br />			<br />			I've used a different oscillator design, the Buchla 259. Features have been added (octave switching) and others removed (autotune &amp; remote). The building of this design is another story. This link also has bare sound samples of the 259 oscillator showing timbre, amplitude and pitch modulation as well as phase lock<br />			<br />			The Easel balanced modulator shows up as the top switch in the oscillator modulation switch. The switch selects <br />1. pre-amp only, 2. balanced modulator with complex and modulation as sources, 3. pre-amp with balanced modulator/mod osc.<br />			<br />				My panel also uses only rotary pots instead of a combination of sliders and pots. This panel has a few additional patch points that on the original were only accessible through the preset cards. I needed to do this as I had decided not to include the card based preset system.</p>		<p>The original Easel would come with a touch sensitive keyboard. I'm going to use my Serge TKB to do this for now.<br />			<br />Sample sound created when doing final testing are at the bottom of this page.<br />			<br />			<br />			<strong>PANEL DESIGN USING ILLUSTRATOR<br />				<br />				Just the panel hardware - knobs, LEDs, switches and jacks.<br />				<br />			</strong><img src="images/259EaselPanelHardware.jpg" alt="" height="387" width="1000" border="0" /><br />			<br />			<br />			<strong>				 The panel design with drill marks<br />				<br />			</strong><img src="images/259EaselPanelFinalOutlines.jpg" alt="" height="412" width="1000" border="0" /><br />			<br />			<strong><br />					Everything!<br />				<br />			</strong><img src="images/259+othertighter.jpg" alt="" height="411" width="1000" border="0" /><br />			<br />			<br />			<strong>MAKING THE FOUR ADDITIONAL CIRCUIT BOARDS (the 259 has 2 more)<br />				<br />			</strong>The blueprints are hand drawn into Adobe Illustrator, then printed with black and white laser toner, then etched and drilled. <br />			<br />			<img src="images/P1010117.jpg" alt="" height="451" width="800" border="0" /><br />			<strong><br />				<img src="images/buchlaEaselENV-Gen_PulserBo.gif" alt="" height="608" width="800" border="0" /><br />				<br />			</strong><img src="images/P1010089.jpg" alt="" height="533" width="800" border="0" /><br />			<br />			<br />			<strong>The first 2 boards are stuffed with parts </strong><br />			<br />			<img src="images/P1010114.jpg" alt="" height="451" width="800" border="0" /><br />			<br />			<br />			<strong>All the boards now ready </strong><strong>for a total of 6 boards<br />				<br />				<img src="images/P1010118sm.jpg" alt="" height="451" width="800" border="0" /><br />				<br />			</strong><br />			<strong>Working on the enclosure.
